JAY:
That was a great ad read, Mike. But don't forget that this episode is also sponsored by Pill Pack. "Skip the pharmacy lines. Pill Pack sorts and delivers your medication right to your door."

MIKE:
I don't have a door.

JAY:
"Taking medication should be easy. Make the switch and get started with Pill Pack today. Delivers to you each month."

MIKE:
How much more is there?

JAY:
"Your, your pills sorted by the dose." I think I'm done. I'm done with that ad read.

MIKE:
Is he done? There's, oh, wait, there's another ad. Ad by Lola: "Organic feminine care subscription box. Have a simpler period with natural products delivered to your door. No additives. Tampons starting at $8."

JAY:
Now that we've paid the bills, we can start the show.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay, and welcome to another episode of The Nerd Crew. I'm Mike, and I'd like to say I'm the world's biggest Star Wars fan, but have you ever been to a Disney Expo?

JAY:
And I'm Jay. And ever since Disney took over Star Wars my life has been a..."magical kingdom of endless Star Wars magic."

MIKE:
Say that again. We can, with a little more energy, we can edit around that.

JAY:
Which part? I thought I did it all perfectly.

MIKE:
No, no, the part about "endless fucking magic" or something.

JAY:
Okay. But I don't have to do the first part again?

MIKE:
No, no. The, the line Rick wrote for you, you know, from from PR.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Just do it again. I'll cut all this out.

JAY:
All right. "A magical kingdom of endless Star Wars magic."

MIKE:
That was perfect. I'm gonna cut all this out.

JAY:
Cut this part out because it's the most embarrassing sh-.

MIKE:
Well, Jay, we sent rich down to Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in Florida to report back live. Rich? Rich? Are you there?

RICH:
The fucking park's closed. Flight was delayed three times. And it took me fucking 36 hours to get home.

MIKE:
Well, Jay and I just got back from Hollywood, California, where we went to a theme park ride that wasn't closed. It was the soft opening premiere of the new attraction, Rise of the Resistance.

JAY:
We got invited to a little, uh, oh, I don't know what they call it, "sneak peak". Is that what the little people say.

MIKE:
I think they say that in the tabloids sometimes, or on TV shows. Uh, really we like to call it a "soft opening" in the biz.

JAY:
No big deal.

MIKE:
"Sneak preview" is a little flyover. We say "soft opening". Yes. Because we're influencers with a lot of Twitter followers, Disney went through our tweet history and vetted us, finding no evidence of any negative comments about Star Wars. Thus, we were invited to this exclusive premiere event.

JAY:
Yes, Mike, it was very exclusive. And no, no humble bragging here. Just bragging.

RICH:
Oh, so, so Disney vetted us before inviting us, you know, to make sure we, we only said positive things about, about the brand? Huh. That sounds an awful lot like China's social credit score.

JK:
The fuck is he talking about?

MIKE:
Um, cut the cameras.

JAY:
Cut this part out. Cut this all out.

MIKE:
Just cut the cameras. Cut the cameras. Cut as mu-...Jay and I will now share our thoughts while we show you some pics that we snapped at the event.

JAY:
Rise of the Resistance is the most impressive ride I have ever been on. I do not think people are ready for the scale, the scope, the surprises, and the immersiveness of this soon to be iconic attraction. Folks, it's a game changer.

RICH:
Oh, wow.

MIKE:
There's nothing like #riseoftheresistance. You've got to experience it for yourself.

RICH:
Oh, wow.

MIKE:
Everyone can do this ride.

JAY:
I thought #riseoftheresistance would have me screaming aloud, but it instead left me speechless.

RICH:
Oh, wow.

JAY:
I am overwhelmed to the point of confusion by its existence. MIKE:It's an experiential journey you'll want to have again and again. What an absolute triumph!

MIKE:
Oh, wait. Clapping might trigger some of our more sensitive audience members.

JAY:
Oh.

JAY:
So you're basically just riding around in a Death Star set, and whenever like a stormtrooper or a bad guy pops up, the ride backs up? I, I, I mean...I mean, that sounds amazing!

MIKE:
A triumph!

JAY:
I have to keep smiling! I have to keep smiling!

MIKE:
So let's get this show on the road! December is a month with a very popular religious holiday. It's called Star Wars: Episode XI: Rise of Skywalker.

RICH:
Can't wait!

MIKE:
And, boy, oh, boy, even though no one really cares, this movie seems to be all over the news.

RICH:
Mike, everyone cares. You said no one cares.

MIKE:
What? Oh, you're right. Yes, everyone cares so much that Disney's crack PR team has been forced to create fake viral news stories in order to desperately keep interest alive.

RICH:
Can't wait.

JAY:
Uh, now Mike, you said "fake news stories". I think what you meant was "real news stories that just happened organically".

RICH:
Oh, Mike. Have you been taking your vitamin D?

MIKE:
Yes, which is why I totally believe the news story that John Boyega left a 100% complete screenplay to Rise of the Skywalker in his hotel room, which the maid found and gave to someone to sell on eBay, then somehow Disney got the screenplay back without anyone copying its contents or reading it. Wow, this news story sure makes it seem like everyone is clamoring to find out what this shitshow story is gonna be about.

CLIP:
"And so, you know, they, they had only a handful of scripts, and they were printed on crazy uncopyable paper, and it was, uh..."

JAY:
Now the interesting thing I heard is that the script was printed with ink that cannot be photocopied. And in this world, nobody has cell phones with cameras on them.

MIKE:
That's a myth. Mythbusters proved that. Cell phone cameras are a myth. That's right. And even though this would have been an embarrassing blunder by the actor, the studio, and a legal nightmare for both the hotel chain and the maid, JJ Abrams went on Good Morning America to tell the whole world about it.

CLIP:
"And then one of our actors, I'm not gonna say which one -- I want to, but I won't -- left it under in their bed, and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place, and it was given to someone else who then went to sell it on eBay, and, uh..."

MIKE:
Sure makes for a great viral headline about how anticipated people are for this movie.

JAY:
I love real news.

RICH:
Yeah. People are so excited especially after two trailers came out with absolutely no information and nobody cared.

MIKE:
While we're on the subject of trailers and clips from Rise of the Skywalker, this movie has done something new, which the other two films have not. JJ Abrams and Disney have released 30 seconds of the film online.

RICH:
Whoa!

CLIP:
"Oh, they fly now!"

CLIP:
"They fly now?"

CLIP:
"They fly now!"

RICH:
They fly now.

MIKE:
They fly now.

JAY:
I heard they fly now.

RICH:
They fly now.

JAY:
Repeating something over and over is comedy.

RICH:
They fly now.

MIKE:
Comedy comes in three's, everybody. They fly now.

RICH:
They fly now. Oh, yeah. Thanks, bye. Guys, this just in! My source tells me that Rise of Skywalker is already on track to being one of the most popular and successful films of all time.

JAY:
Wow, that is a catchy headline. What's your source?

RICH:
It doesn't matter. Did you read the headline? The Rise of Skywalker is already on track to be one of the most popular and successful films of all time.

MIKE:
I mean, Rich, that is great news. Especially for Star Wars fans like us. That headline brings me such comfort. I loved reading it. I love the information that that headline contained. Reading it made me feel safe and secure that I'm gonna like Rise of Skywalker. But, Rich, what are your facts? What method did your source use...

RICH:
Box office information, market research, smart people in the industry, it doesn't matter. The Rise of Skywalker is already on track to being one of the most popular and successful films of all time.

MIKE:
So what you're saying is the Rise of Skywalker is already on track to being one of the most popular and successful films of all time, with no information to back that up.

RICH:
Well, I just heard that on a podcast that we are currently making.

MIKE:
I just want to say again how much I love that headline. Um, and, and really, now that I think about it, I don't care what the facts are to support that statement. I like the statement so much. I think most news outlets should carry this story. You don't even have to write an article. As long as you have that headline that people will read and then flip past, they will get the point that Star Wars, the Rise of Skywalker, is already on track to being one of the most popular and successful films of all time.

RICH:
Whoo!

JAY:
You did it again, Star Wars!

MIKE:
I, I love the movie. I love the movie.

JAY:
It's not out yet.

MIKE:
I'm gonna love this movie.

JAY:
And if this all wasn't enough, there's even more news. Let's not forget about #stormdisneyhq, which I'm all about.

RICH:
What's #stormdisneyhq?

JAY:
It was a movement where 500,000 fans were planning to literally storm Disney's offices and demand to see an early edit of Rise of Skywalker. Uh, JJ Abrams talked about it on The View.

RICH:
Oh, Jay, that was proven to be a fake news story that Disney created to drum up enthusiasm.

MIKE:
That's right, Rich. Silly Jay. You know that at the release of every new Star Wars film, the only real way to see the movie early is to be a manchild dying in hospice.

RICH:
I'd give myself terminal brain cancer in order to see the Rise of Skywalker early.

JAY:
That's fake news!

MIKE:
That can't be real. Is that real? Wait, that happens every movie.

RICH:
No, it's real.

MIKE:
Well, guys, now that we're finally on the topic of Star Wars fake news, a company known for its viral pranks has created a fake Star Wars action figure.

RICH:
Fake Star Wars action figures?

MIKE:
That's right, Rich. It's called a red stormtrooper, or a "Sith trooper".

MIKE:
Now the thing is...

JAY:
Like a stormtrooper that has Force powers?

MIKE:
Yes, that's the thing, yeah.

RICH:
Oh, that's so stupid.

MIKE:
It's a, it has Sith powers, like, like a limited Sith power. And it's red, like a red lightsaber.

RICH:
It's like Star Wars would have no idea if that were true.

MIKE:
They've run out of ideas.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah, it's like they've completely run out of things to do with their toys and characters.

MIKE:
And, and to just suggest that a stormtrooper has a Sith power is, it's hilarious.

JAY:
And it's so authentic looking, too.

MIKE:
I know, I know.

JAY:
That's what really sells the gag.

MIKE:
I mean, yeah. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, you're watching it. It's live, it's live. What?

RICH:
Uh, now guys, recent polls show that 0% of children are interested in the new Star Wars toys, and in fact interest is waning in the embarrassing manchild demographic as well. And just look, the Star Wars section at Target has been shrunken down to just a few feet of oddball figures and toys. And on clearance, too.

MIKE:
You mean like this figure here of Snook?

RICH:
Who?

MIKE:
Snoke, Snoke.

RICH:
Who is he?

MIKE:
I don't know. Some guy in a gold dress.

RICH:
Besides releasing cringy ads directed at kids like this.

CLIP:
"Hi, Young Jedi".

CLIP:
"Everything has been leading to this".

CLIP:
"Perfect, now it's looking good".

RICH:
I'm not sure what else Disney can do.

MIKE:
Eww, yeah. I hate to admit it, Rich, but watching kids play Jedi and Sith in 2019 kind of feels like watching kids play Cowboys and Indians. It feels so dated.

RICH:
Cringy.

MIKE:
Embarrassing.

JAY:
Pathetic.

MIKE:
It just feels wrong. I mean, it's amazing!

JAY:
I love Star Wars! Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
We may have audience members with sensitivity to sound. I fucking love Star Wars!

JAY:
Yeah, you can really tell those kids just don't give a shit. I mean, they look like they're having a great time playing these angry miserable characters!

MIKE:
That's right, Jay. Kids today prefer shit like Fortnite or Paw Patrol or Minecraft or robotic dinosaur monsters. Stuff like that.

JAY:
Anything but Star Wars.

MIKE:
Literally, they'll play with anything but Star Wars toys. Because we have them all.

JAY:
Yeah, sexually ambiguous lady who constantly wears beige, and sexually ambiguous man who constantly wears black just isn't really appealing to anyone. Except maybe Robert Eggers.

MIKE:
And gay robots is so 1977.

JAY:
Wait, Mike, shut up. We've gone all this time and we haven't talked about Baby Yoda.

MIKE:
Oh, my god. Have we talked about Baby Yoda? So cute.

RICH:
I have pictures of baby Yoda on my underwear.

MIKE:
Now for those of you who don't know, there's a new show called Mandolin, and Baby Yoda is in it. The show stars Boba Fett, and Boba Fett finds baby Yoda in a space egg. And everyone just loves Baby Yoda. And rightfully so. I mean, he's got those big eyes. He looks like Gizmo. I mean, people have pointed that out. And, you know, for a show about a very cold bounty hunter who, you know, he, he doesn't really say much, we needed a little warmth. We needed a little cuteness in such a cold dark miserable universe that Star Wars is that kids love. We needed a cute baby. And I have a theory about Baby Yoda.

JAY:
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

RICH:
Ooh.

JAY:
Is this an exclusive.

MIKE:
This is an exclusive. People call him Baby Yoda, obviously, because he is of the same race that was Yoda. And he looks like Yoda. He could be Baby Yoda. But of course the real Yoda died in Return of the Jedi. And, of course, the Mandolin takes place after Return of the Jedi. Um, and now we've all theorized that Rise of the Skywalkers has a time-travel plot. Now I think in the Rise of the Skywalkers, the plot is the Emperor -- Emperor Palpatine -- he survived the explosion of the second Death Star, and he's living in an alternate universe with 10,000 Star Destroyers. He flies out of the alter-...he emerges from the alternate universe, tells everyone he's back, but he's going to use a magic star crystal to time-travel back to when Yoda was a little baby -- maybe 50 or so -- and stab him with star crystal right in his fucking eye.

JAY:
Wow, that sounds very violent.

MIKE:
Because Yoda might have been one of the, the early founders of the Jedi Order. So if Palpatine could kill Yoda, you know, when he was a little baby, he could potentially stop the Jedi Order from rising in the first place and control the universe for even longer. But Rey and Poe and Finn and Ben and Doe and Zinn all find out about this plot, and they stop the Emperor by saving Baby Yoda. But they launch Baby Yoda into a time stream and he just appears, uh, in a space egg in, in the show The Mandolin starring Boba Fett.

RICH:
Mike, Mike, Mike, the show is called The Mandorian.

CLIP:
"Surprise, happy birthday".

MIKE:
Now our podcast, The Nerd Crew, was recently voted the 143rd-most popular Star Wars podcast, right after such hit podcasts as The Cantina Crew, Jabberin' Jawas, Down in the Trench, Sarlacc Pit Masters, which is also a podcast about barbeque.

JAY:
Endless Trash Compactors, Not So Boring Conversation Anyway.

MIKE:
And Cry for Help. But to celebrate our new ranking and the release of Rise of the Skywalkers, we're doing a YouTube live auction, and we've got some great Star Wars merch for you to bid on and all proceeds will go to charity.

JAY:
What charity?

RICH:
Very cool.

JAY:
Wow.

MIKE:
Well, Jay, it's called Fast Track, and it's a great charity. What they do is they implant aggressive cancerous tumors into your body so that you have the chance to see Rise of Skywalker before you die.

JAY:
Wonderful charity. Wonderful.

RICH:
Didn't Omaze used to do a big charity push when a new Star Wars movie came out?

CLIP:
"Hey guys, Mark and Daisy here, and you're gonna want to listen to this."

CLIP:
"To celebrate the 40th anniversary of Star Wars, we're offering fans the chance to win not one, but three once-in-a-lifetime Star Wars experiences."

MIKE:
You're right, Rich. They did, but the last Jedi charity drive did so poorly they ended up in the negative...after all the administration costs and everything.

JAY:
That's unfortunate. You know, I donated a dollar for the chance to massage Anthony Daniels's prostate.

RICH:
What happened to the orphanage it was going to fund?

MIKE:
Uh, the orphanage had to close its doors. Anthony Daniels's wanted to get paid. They shipped all the orphans off to Thailand...to work in a sweatshop...making Star Wars toys.

JAY:
Well, in Anthony Daniels's defense, I mean, he did play C-3PO.

MIKE:
Uh, yeah, I'm not sure who ended up massaging Anthony Daniel's prostate.

RICH:
I did.

JAY:
Wow, you think with a name like C-3PO, he'd be into golden showers.

RICH:
He is. He pissed on my face while saying, "Take that, Kenny Baker!"

MIKE:
Well, everyone, it's time to start the auction! Now remember, all proceeds go to the charity Fast Track. So your bid will help one lucky fan get an early death and a possible chance at seeing Rise of the Skywalker early.

RICH:
The number to call is 1-888-905-7888.

MIKE:
So let's start the auction.

RICH:
Jay, what's our first item to auction off?

JAY:
Well, first up, we have a Kylo Ren product. Twelve Days of Socks.

RICH:
Ooh.

MIKE:
Yes, amazing. That's great. Just in time for Christmas. Phone lines are open, by the way. The number's on the screen. So if you want to bid on this item, I believe retail, it goes for maybe about $20. So we're starting off pretty simple, you know. Uh, so, you know, the phone lines are open.

JAY:
Are the phones plugged in?

MIKE:
I think so, yeah. Let me just make sure I have it.

JAY:
Do you, do you get a dial tone?

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, they're working.

JAY:
Okay. All right. Then any moment now. Call ahead and get 12 Days of Socks with Kylo Ren.

MIKE:
Well, uh, maybe if you're not interested in 12 Days of Socks, how about 15 Days of Socks.

RICH:
Ooh.

MIKE:
Why, that's three more days of socks. Um, and these are, these are not, uh, specifically not Kylo Ren socks.

JAY:
These are all of Star Wars.

MIKE:
Uh, it looks like original trilogy.

RICH:
Combined, you get 27 Days of Socks.

MIKE:
If you bid on both items.

JAY:
That's true, that's true.

MIKE:
Phone lines are open.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
That's almost a full month worth of socks. And it's worth pointing out that these, uh, these are real products.

MIKE:
Let's move on to our next item, which is a lot. It is five action figures. Um, I believe they are the, like, the deluxe edition or something. But we have, uh, well, they're autographed.

JAY:
They're all autographed by the stars of the films!

MIKE:
By the actors themselves.

RICH:
Not, not prints. Those are actual autographs.

MIKE:
Those are signed autographs donated by Disney for this wonderful charity. We have, uh, uh, Finn -- John, John Boyega -- uh, Kylo Ren autographed by, uh, Adam Driver, of course. Uh, Rich, the black woman, what's her name?

RICH:
Uh, yes, that is the, the, the new character.

MIKE:
And her name, the actress?

RICH:
Of the final film, uh...

JAY:
And Daisy Ridley's character, Rey, uh, autographed by Daisy Ridley, of course. And lastly, uh, we have Poe Dameron, played by the great Oscar Isaac. Uh, all autographed, ready to go. So, yeah, uh, phone lines are open, and bidding starts at $10.

MIKE:
Did he say the number right?

JAY:
Did you say the number, Rich?

MIKE:
Can you repeat it, maybe, just...

RICH:
1-888-905-7888.

MIKE:
And, and, you know, no, no phone charges, uh, toll-free, as they say, um...

JAY:
Well, Mike, Rich, I mean, maybe people, uh, just aren't interested in this charity. I mean, it is kind of weird. Who wants to die early just to see a movie a couple weeks in advance?

MIKE:
It's true.

JAY:
Uh, maybe we should change charities?

MIKE:
Uh, sure, okay, uh, the backup charity that we have is called End AIDS. It's a charity that puts 100% of its proceeds into R&D to develop a vaccine for the AIDS virus. We could, we could eradicate the disease all over the planet in just a generation.

JAY:
And all they need is a few thousand dollars more.

MIKE:
They're so close.

JAY:
They're so close, and we can help them with our charity.

MIKE:
Yes, so let's put our next, uh, lot up for auction.

JAY:
All right.

MIKE:
Which is a series of also autographed Star Wars movie posters.

JAY:
It works.

RICH:
Can we make that number larger on the screen?

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Rick, can you make the number larger? I mean, people are watching this on YouTube, it might be too small to see.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

RICH:
That Empire Strikes Back poster is signed by Irvin Kershner, Mark Hamill Harrison Ford...

MIKE:
Wow.

RICH:
Carrie Fisher.

MIKE:
Oh, wow.

RICH:
What an inspiration she was.

JAY:
RIP, RIP.

RICH:
RIP, RIP.

MIKE:
She is an inspiration to us all.

JAY:
Well, guys, I don't want to speak too early, but I'm gonna say that this charity drive is going very poorly.

MIKE:
This charity's doing amazing thing. So let's bring out our final item.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
It is an amazing large poster of all the Star Wars characters, uh, signed by just about everyone...

RICH:
Oh, wow.

MIKE:
...in the Star Wars universe.

RICH:
Oh, wow.

MIKE:
I don't even know how many signatures are on this poster. There's way too many to count.

JAY:
We had to pull a lot of strings to get this.

MIKE:
Yes. Do you think anybody's watching? Or is there just no interest in Star Wars anymore?

JAY:
That can't possibly be the case, right?

RICH:
Star Wars is eternal.

JAY:
Star Wars is eternal.

MIKE:
Because it's about family.

JAY:
And that's what makes it so powerful.

MIKE:
Yeah. It's not ringing. It didn't ring.

RICH:
I thought I heard. Ah, fuck this.

MIKE:
What are you doing? Rich, what are you doing?

RICH:
My GrubHub's not showing up, so I'm gonna make a sandwich. I got, I got this Darth Vader toaster, and I'm gonna make a fucking sandwich.

MIKE:
Oh, but the toaster was supposed to be part of the auction! I was gonna say, "If you bid on this, you can help make AIDS toast."

JAY:
Like toast with AIDS on it?

MIKE:
No, like like help make AIDS history.

JAY:
AIDS history? Oh, you mean like how the disease started.

MIKE:
No, you stupid idiot.

RICH:
This toast isn't going into the toaster right.

MIKE:
Push the handle down harder.

RICH:
I'm, I'm smashing the handle as hard as I can.

MIKE:
Push the toast down into it. Shove the toast into the toaster.

RICH:
Shut up, hold on. I'm got some fucking duct tape.

JAY:
This is a very unorthodox way to make toast.

RICH:
I'm hungry.

MIKE:
You, duct, you're, oh, oh, so this is, you're duct taping it so...

RICH:
So the toast stays in the toaster.

JAY:
Okay, okay.

MIKE:
Well, turn it on high just just to make sure it toasts properly. It seems like he's messing with the electronics of this, this dangerous kitchen item a little too aggressively, Jay.

JAY:
Well, does that mean it'll be worth more in the auction because it's screen-used?

RICH:
It's still not working right. I'm going to use these Star Wars utensils to just fidget around in here.

MIKE:
Is that a lightsaber fork?

RICH:
Fork's stuck, hold on. I'm gonna butter up the spoon.

MIKE:
Uh, maybe you should unplug it first?

JAY:
Well, now's a good time to remind everybody that the phone lines are open.

MIKE:
That's right, the phone lines are still open...

JAY:
Absolutely.

MIKE:
...if you wanna bid on any of the auction items that we have.

MIKE:
Oh, oh god, it's sparking.

JAY:
Oh, Jesus.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
I did not expect this to happen.

MIKE:
Oh, god, Rich. Get the toast out, It's gonna start a fire!

RICH:
I'm gonna get the toast out.

MIKE:
Oh, god. Oh, fuck!

RICH:
Oh, fuck. I gotta...

JAY:
Jesus Christ, there's so much smoke!

MIKE:
How did this get in front of me?

RICH:
Oh, god. Quick, hand me that Sith trooper!

JAY:
Oh, Jesus Christ. There's so much smoke.

RICH:
Oh, god. Okay, I can't stop. Hold on, I've got an idea, I've got an idea.

MIKE:
Rich, where are you going?

JAY:
Oh, god, the phone's ringing. Hello? Oh, my god, they wanna bid $5,000 on the autographed Star Wars poster.

RICH:
Okay, okay, I've got this.

MIKE:
Rich, no, no! Oh, god! No, oh, no, it's a mis-, ow! Oh, fuck! Oh, no. Oh. Oh. Oh, no, oh, god.

JAY:
Why did he think this would help?

MIKE:
I don't know.

RICH:
What was this? I got it. I got it.

JAY:
Sir, are you still there? Can I interest you instead in a Daisy Ridley autographed action figure? Hello?
