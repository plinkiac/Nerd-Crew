MIKE:
Hello, I'm Mike Stoklasa, owner of RedLetterMedia, an internet conglomerate corporation.
Currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
And with me today is...

JAY:
Hello, I'm Jay.
I'm just a really big, uh, fan of movies.
I'm what you might call a "film geek", as they say, or a "movie nerd".
Uh, owever you want to label it.
I just, I just love movies.

RICH:
And I'm Rich Evans.

JAY:
And I'd like to talk about our sponsor today, which is Garnier Fructis, a hair product for fun.

RICH:
And I'd like to talk about our amazing diabetes medicine called Avandamet.

MIKE:
Hey, hey, guys.
One sponsor at a time.
Now I'm sure you at home have noticed our brand new set, which is courtesy of Sony Pictures.

JAY:
Very cool.

RICH:
Very cool.

MIKE:
It's amazing.
It's simply amazing.
Now, in an unrelated note, I'd like to talk about a couple new movies that are coming out this year that we're very excited about.

JAY:
Very excited.

RICH:
Oh, yes, very excited.

JAY:
Very excited.
So excited.

MIKE:
Smurfs: The Lost Village.
I can't wait.
Spider-Man: Homecoming.
The Dark Tower.
The Emoji Movie.
And the Jumanji remake, which I am personally very excited about.

JAY:
The Rock.
Very cool, very cool.

MIKE:
It's gonna be a big film.
It's gonna be a huge film.
It's gonna be huge.

RICH:
But, Mike.
When can we talk about the new Justice League trailer?

MIKE:
Hold tight, Rich.
We both know you're really excited about that film.
How do we know that Because we secretly filmed you watching the trailer.
Check it out!

RICH:
You what?
All right.
Let's watch this shit.
Okay.
Justice League trailer, official.
What?
Is that a horse?

WONDER WOMAN:
The others.
Where are they?

RICH:
I can't see anything.
Why is it so dark?
Oh, my god.
That was awful.
Oh.
Oh, my god.
Amazing trailer.
Simply amazing.

JAY:
Now, Rich.
Before we get to that, though, we need to talk about all the new and exciting things happening in the world of Star Wars.

MIKE:
Which is not to be confused with Star Wars Land.
Opening in 2019.
Tickets available soon.

RICH:
Yeah, yes.
So many new and exciting things going on with Star Wars.
A series that has been creatively bankrupt since 1983.

JAY:
What did he just say?

MIKE:
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.
I was enjoying this hot beverage.
Well, me personally, guys I love Marvel and DC.
But I think Star Wars is my favorite verse.

RICH:
Verse.

MIKE:
Short for "expanded universe", gosh.
Get with the long-form storytelling multi-film connected expanded universe, grandpa.

RICH:
Very cruel.
Very cruel.

MIKE:
Now this might be old news to some of you out there, but recently Bob showed Disney shareholders some exclusive footage from Episode VIII.

JAY:
Now Mike, uh, when you say Bob, you may have to explain who you're talking about.

MIKE:
Oh, I'm sorry.
Bob Iger, Disney CEO.

JAY:
Yeah.
He's very cool.
Very cool.

RICH:
Yes, yes.

MIKE:
I took a photo with him at a convention once.

JAY:
Oh, very cool.
Very cool.

RICH:
Very cool.

JAY:
So you, you have the inside scoop then?

MIKE:
We wrapped about the biz.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
You know, I said, I said...well, he said:
"Who are you?"
"Uh, get away from me."
And I said:
"Can I have a photo with you?"
And, and then, you know, I said:
"I know who you are."
"You're Bob Iger."
"You're the CEO of Disney."
And he said, he said:
"What do you want?
"Money?"
He said he was gonna call the police.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And I said:
"Uh, this is a little embarrassing."
But I said:
"Tell me what what the plans are with Star Wars, and I'll suck your dick."

JAY:
Okay.
I think anyone in your position would make that same offer.

MIKE:
And then, you know, somebody pushed me down.
And, and I can't really remember much after that.
But, uh, me and Bob we go way back.
We go way back.

JAY:
Very cool.

RICH:
Very cool.
Very cool.

MIKE:
Anyway, here's what we know.
So, guys, according to my friend, Dan, who is an industry insider, here's why.

RICH:
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you mean, Daniel Miller, the LA Times reporter?
Yeah, he tweeted all this weeks ago.
Everybody knows this, Mike.

MIKE:
What we know so far is that the first line of dialogue in Episode VII is:
"Who are you?"

JAY:
Oh, wow.


RICH:
Wow, wow.

MIKE:
And this line of dialogue is spoken by Luke Skywalker.
Now, I think this line of dialogue speaks volumes, because it's not just a literal:
"Who are you?"
It's"
"Who are you?"
And, really, that just gives me the chills.

RICH:
Oh, wow.
So, so, Luke talks in the film.

MIKE:
And another shocking revelation revealed is that Rey has been seen using a lightsaber.

RICH:
She, she did in the last film.

MIKE:
What?

RICH:
And in The Force Awakens.

MIKE:
I know, and it was very cool.

JAY:
Now, Mike, I think the question that we need to ask is: whose lightsaber is it?

MIKE:
That's a good question.

JAY:
Does she continue to use the Skywalker lightsaber?

MIKE:
Those are very good questions.

JAY:
Does Luke have one of his own?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Or does he help her build one as part of her Jedi training?

MIKE:
That's a very good question.

JAY:
There are literally three possibilities.

MIKE:
Now I also learned from my friend, Dan, that Episode VII is gonna treat us to many new vistas.

JAY:
Ooh, ooh, I love those vistas.

MIKE:
Mountains.

JAY:
Ooh.

MIKE:
Forests.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Oceans.

JAY:
Ooh.

MIKE:
Deserts.
Sky.

JAY:
So many vistas.

MIKE:
Dirt.

RICH:
Ugh.

MIKE:
Ice.

JAY:
So many vistas.

MIKE:
Water.
Air.
Probably the inside of a spaceship.
And other vistas.

JAY:
So many vistas.

MIKE:
Will the desert planet be Tatooine?
Will it be Jakku?
Or will it be a totally new desert planet?
Is the forest that Dan spoke of Endor?
I literally have two questions.

JAY:
Now, Mike.
While I am super stoked for Episode VIII and IX, as well as Episodes X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, and XXV, what I am really looking forward to is the standalone Han Solo prequel film.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
Well, me personally, I'm very excited to learn about how Han Solo got his name, where he got his blaster, or his famous belt.
But most importantly, I'm excited to learn how he met Chewbacca.
Now, I think most of you know that George Lucas had originally planned to have Han Solo raised by Chewbacca as a small boy on the Wookie planet, Kashyyyk.
Now, I think Disney is scrapping that idea because it's totally gay, and they're going with something more epic and awesome and forgettable.
I mean, memorable.
Memorable.

JAY:
But, Mike, I think the most important thing that we will learn is how Han Solo got the Millennium Falcon.

MIKE:
All right.
Let's give it up for the Falcon!
Yes!
Yes!

JAY:
The Millennium Falcon.
I'm familiar with it.

MIKE:
And you know, Jay, we are guaranteed an appearance by the Millennium Falcon because they released that cast photo, and in the photo I see the cockpit for the Millennium Falcon.

JAY:
I saw that.
I recognized it.
And I appreciated that they put something in the film that I've seen before.

MIKE:L
I mean, how can you make a Han Solo prequel film without having the Millennium Falcon?
People would fucking riot.

JAY:
And as much as I love Star Wars.
Which I do.
Me personally, I love Star Wars.
Uh, I always thought the original films lacked that backstory for Han Solo.
And that's really what held those movies back from being as good as they could be.

MIKE:
Well, I want to know how Han Solo got his boots.
And I want to know what kind of boots they are.
It's very important, because those boots walked around on the inside of a giant space slug where Mynock attacked the Falcon.
And so is, are those boots acid-resistant?
Like, what are they made out of?
Are they Karelian armor?

JAY:
This is a gross oversight in the original trilogy.

MIKE:
And to me, nothing says Star Wars like Woody Harrelson.

RICH:
He bought those boots at the space store.

MIKE:
Rich, I'm fact-checking this on Wookiepedia, and I don't see anything listed about a space store.
Is there a specific name?

JAY:
Did we just uncover, like, do you have an insider that has given you this information?
This is, this is breaking news everybody.

MIKE:
Breaking news.

JAY:
Breaking news.
You were hearing it here first, courtesy of Rich Evans.

MIKE:
Han Solo bought his boots at the space store.
Now what planet would that be on?

RICH:
You, you can't, you can't be fucking serious.
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.
Is every fucking detail in the goddamn Star Wars...
Guys, I think it's finally time to talk about the Justice League trailer, and it looks amazing.

MIKE:
That's right, Rich.
And while the footage was very difficult to see -- dour, depressing, dark, uninspired, monochromatic, and sickening -- it is one of the best trailers I've ever seen in my whole life.

JAY:
Now, I think that the lack of rain and lightning was a very nice touch.
It shows that they're willing to, uh, you know, lighten things up a little bit.

MIKE:
Ha ha ha ha ha!
What's interesting, too, Jay, is that DC seems to be shifting towards a formula like Marvel uses.

JAY:
That's true, Mike.
There was many L-O-L moments in this trailer.
Especially this one from Bruce Wayne.

THE FLASH:
What are your super powers again?

BATMAN:
I'm rich.

JAY:
At least I think that was Bruce Wayne.
The image was very dark.
It could have been, uh, Aquaman.

MIKE:
Or a homeless man.

RICH:
Yeah, because i've always seen Batman as a comic relief character.

MIKE:
Batman can be very funny, Rich.
Haven't you seen The Lego Batman Movie?
It's very funny.

JAY:
And, me personally, I love this trend of including pop songs in these comic book movies as, uh, kind of a counterbalance.

MIKE:
Uh, a concept that was originally pioneered by the film Guardians of the Galaxy.
It, uh, uh, how do you say, "broke new ground".

JAY:
That's right.
First in this trailer we hear the song Seven Nation Army by Jack Black.

MIKE:
Well, technically, Jay, the band is called the White Keys.

RICH:
The, the song is called the Hardest Button to Button by The White Stripes.

MIKE:
Then, of course, the second song used in the trailer is Come Together, which operates on many levels.
Mainly one.
I think the foresight in using that particular song was genius.

JAY:
Well, speaking of the song Come Together, me personally, I love the Rolling Stones.
So I got very excited when I heard that song in this trailer.

MIKE:
One of their best tunes.

JAY:
Ironically, all the DC fanboys that watch this trailer, they also came together.

MIKE:
Audience.
Come together, come together in theaters around the world -- mainly China -- to watch this film.

JAY:
Oh, I was talking about ejaculating.

M
Well, let's talk about the plot to this movie.
Uh, and one interesting note.
No sign of Superman anywhere in the Justice League trailer.
Now why is that?

JAY:
Where is Superman?
Where is Superman in this trailer?

MIKE:
I saw Lois Lane, but they haven't shown us Superman yet.

RICH:
Well, he, he died in the last film.

MIKE:
What?
In, in Man of Steel, Superman died?

RICH:
No, he died in Batman v Superman.
It was the finale of the film.

MIKE:
Oh, shit!
I totally fucking forgot that happened.
I mean, what a memorable scene.
It was a very emotional, very memorable scene.

RICH:
Very touching.
Very moving.

MIKE:
Very touching.

JAY:
Did that movie already come out?

MIKE:
Now guys, I'm gonna go out on a limb, and I'm gonna make some predictions about the film, okay?
One: the movie will look like a muddy rain puddle, a visual equivalent of a pothole.

JAY:
Now Mike, I know a lot of people dog on Zack Snyder for his visual style, uh, because when you think of the Justice League, I think generally people think of something more colorful like this.
But really, the idea of taking a fun group of superheroes saving the day, and giving it the visual style that makes it look like footage of the holocaust, is really a bold choice.
And bold choices should be celebrated, not criticized.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Not, not criticized.

JAY:
Not criticized at all.

MIKE:
In fact, any, any, anyone criticizing the film should be silenced by force.

JAY:
Because I think the problem is that these films are just too smart for some people.
They are so confident in their vision that they are constantly second-guessing themselves and changing their decisions at the last minute.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Which really shows how much they care.

MIKE:
Yeah, they're just following suit in whatever is popular at the moment like a bellwether changing directions at the slightest breeze.

JAY:
But, but only when it comes to music and humor.
And I think that's the, the really interesting thing that they're doing is that, regardless of these comedic elements they add to their films, uh, their movies still look like a fucking nightmare.

RICH:
They're wise enough to see the criticisms of their films, and then keep the things that are criticized and change other things.

MIKE:
Oh, oh.
Oh, no, Jay.
You, you don't eat shampoo.

RICH:
So my question now is, now that we have, you know, the full trailer for the Justice League movie, what what kind of information can we get about the movie itself based on the trailer?

JAY:
That's right.
So many great films to look forward to.

MIKE:
What?

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Is, is your phone...

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
What's going on here?

MIKE:
Blowing up.

JAY:
Oh, my god.
Oh, oh, I, uh, oh, this is breaking news.
The Spider-Man: Homecoming full trailer is now online.
Oh, my god.

RICH:
Oh, wow.
Wow.

JAY:
Oh.
Oh.

MIKE:
Uh, Todd from Sony's calling me.
I gotta take this.

JAY:
Oh, shit.

RICH:
Okay, okay.

MIKE:
Hey, Todd.
What's up?

JAY:
Oh, fuck.
There's already been 36,000 trailer reaction videos on youtube.
We're already behind the curve, Rich.

RICH:
Oh, shit.

MIKE:
No, no.
I haven't seen it yet.
I am doing a show on the, is it Justice League?

JAY:
The Justice League, yeah.
The new DC product.

MIKE:
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I, I get them all confused.
Yeah.
The Justice Jeague.
That's different than Avengers, right?
Yeah, okay.
Uh, no.
I'm gonna check out this, uh, the Spider-Man thing after we're wrapped here, uh, and then, you know, we'll get a breakdown ready and going soon.

JAY:
I just got 15 emails, uh, from, from the higher-ups.
They want us to talk about the Spider-Man: Homecoming today.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Like, like now.

MIKE:
We're, we're gonna get to it.
I haven't even watched the fucking trailer yet.

RICH:
Did the check clear?
Do I like it?

MIKE:
They're saying to downplay the fact that this is the third reboot.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, and to not mention Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield, uh, to Sony.
They don't exist anymore in those movies.

JAY:
Sure, sure.

MIKE:
Okay.
All right.
That sounds good, Todd.
We will get shooting on this right away.
We're gonna have to remember to cut all this.

JAY:
Yeah.
Note to our editor.
Make sure you cut all this out of the final video.

MIKE:
Yeah, um, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll get this up probably in 24 hours or less, um....

JAY:
We should probably have it up quicker than that.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Hopefully 12, um...

RICH:
We can save time.
We'll watch the trailer afterwards.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Todd wants it up within the hour.

JAY:
Okay.
We can do that.

MIKE:
Well, the problem is, is Rick, our editor, he's at the hospital.
His wife's having a baby.

JAY:
Oh, fuck.

MIKE:
I know.
That fucking bitch.
Listen.
I, I will tell him to to to get here ASAP.
I know this is important.
It's another superhero film and it's a big deal.
Um, and you know, we got to get the word out.
So, yeah.
I'll call Rick right now, and we'll get this, we'll get this shit going, um, uh, all right, Todd.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Best.
Bye.

RICH:
I'll be right back.
I have to go take my Avandamet.
