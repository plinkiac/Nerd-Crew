hey everyone
the 2015 San Diego Comicon recently wrapped up
and that means only one thing
that we're super stoked for all the new and exciting stuff coming for us nerds
that's right
mainly movies
big dawn loud action movies
hi guys
can I join in on the discussion
what the fuck
who the fuck asked you
nobody
but I'm I'm a real nerd
real nerds don't sit alone in their bedrooms everyday reading comic books during their formative high school years
or like science fiction novels
or sit around playing video games until they get arthritis
or have an actual interest in hard science and space exploration
yeah
real nerds spend just a few hours a month watching big dumb comic book movies
and then they buy a pre faded Captain America shirt from Target
he's right
you know he's right
listen pencil-neck
it's cool to say you're a nerd
but it's still not cool to be a nerd
so seriously bro stay the fuck out of our focus group approved marketing video
I mean video
so I don't know what you're doing between 2016 and 2029 but I know what we'll be doing
watching movies
and it's not just the run-of-the-mill prequels and remakes that we're really excited about
no it's all the standalone expanded universe materials
so many materials
that's right Jay
you know Marvel used to have the market cornered with its cinematic universe
but now that DC and Star Wars are getting in the game it's giving me
a huge boner
no
I was gonna say it's giving me a reason to live
actually both of those are kind of awkward
shut the fuck up
nobody asked you you mother fucker
well for the rest of the summer as far as marvelous concern the only big movie is ant-man
no pun intended
but whoa
look out for 2016
uh you didn't know that ant-man beat his wife right
like he literally beat her up in addition to being in Star Wars Episode seven Oscar Isaac is also starring as apocalypse in x-men apocalypse
so you could forget about Oscar Isaac taking on quality roles in small thought-provoking indie dramas
cuz now he loves money
"we're in the money"
"we're in the money"
just like us nerds
right
homeless man
hey get yourself a shirt and tie buddy
they'll do wonders for your image
of being a nerd
legit nerd from the streets am i right
is that it what a nerd is
no
tru dat
also out in 2016 Captain America Civil War Deadpool and Doctor Strange movie
is that like dr. Strangelove
is that a remake
and don't forget about the standalone gambit film starring Channing Tatum
Channing Tatum
I loved him in 22 Jump Street
that movie was the bombdizzle
plus our marketing team thinks he can capture that highly sought-after 12 percent 18 to 24 female demo
you know the kind of consumer base that wouldn't normally see a standalone gambit product
I mean film
but gambit's a tall lanky man who speaks with a Cajun accent
how is
no one fucking asked you you fucking cocksucker
Channing Tatum's fucking awesome
yeah
and try to put some fucking cologne on
you won't smell like a dumpster
they're also slated to make a black panther film the Inhumans and a third spider-man reboot
yeah I'm actually looking forward to the new spider-man reboot
I mean the person that cast they actually looks like a teenager
would you shut the fuck up
oh wait you said you're looking forward to it
how much money do you have
anyway this is all for the service of not three not four not five but six Avengers infinity war movies
oh my god
I could smell the money now
I mean popcorn
I could smell the popcorn now
I do smell popcorn
oh my god
he has popcorn
it's so disgusting the way these nerds eat
I've never had this popped corn myself but I'm told the masses love it
another cool thing shown at San Diego comic-con was the trailer for Batman vs Superman Age of Justice
dawn of Justice
whatever
who cares
it doesn't matter
why is Batman wearing the Batmobile
he's not wearing the Batmobile idiot
that's his new super armored suit
it's super powerful bad armor that he needs to beat up Superman with
but didn't Superman like destroy metropolis barehanded in the last movie
yeah
but that's what Batman needs super powerful armor so that he could smash up Superman
duh
you think you're so smart
I thought you read comic books
but that was just one design
there were several other designs that didn't get good focus group feedback
like this
and this
and this
speaking of Batman now that Ben is getting divorced from Jen he's slated to write direct produce and act in five more Batman films
slated for 2016 2017 2018 2019 and 2018
that's right
and that's good news too because those Christopher Nolan movies suck so hard
plus Ben Affleck is awesome
he was already in an awesome superhero movie called daredevil
that movie fucking rocked
why is Ben Affleck getting divorced
well Jay i'm glad you asked
their love had been Bruce waning for a while
in fact he lied to her so often she called him a two-face
rumor is too he liked to get kinky in the bedroom
he always wanted to put his Batmobile on her Batcave
she didn't like that she said it gave her a rash like poison ivy
so she served him divorce papers and called him a joker
let's just get this over with
uh Wonder Woman film
uh the flash
Suicide Squad movie
uh Aquaman
cyborg
and a Green Lantern film slated for 2020
oh my god
the Green Lantern
I love that movie
what
shut up
I hate you
so is that it
all these standalone movies doesn't DC have anything to counter marvel's infinity war films
hey aren't they doing at least two Justice League movies in 2017 and 2019
that fucking nerd knows more than us
what the hell is the Justice League
i don't know
some sort of fucking comic book thing
now let's get to what a real cinematic universe is going to look like
that's right Mike
ever since Disney bought the rights to Star Wars they've been making bigger plans than Hitler
that's right
the floodgates have opened with sequels spin-offs and standalone films
enough Star Wars movies to make you want to gouge your fucking eyes out
I mean gouge your wallet out of money
can we cut that
sure
the part where I said gouge your fucking eyes out
yeah that was a weird thing to say
well I mean it's it it's like four films a year
oh my god
are people gonna get sick of all these spin-offs and standalone films cinematic universes
oh the fucking camera's rolling
in 2016 we'll get Star Wars rogue one from director Gareth Edwards the guy who made the most recent Godzilla movie
that's right Jay
and rumor is there's gonna be an appearance from Darth Vader
I remember him
he was in Star Wars
I'm assuming he's gonna get his own standalone movie at some point
just shut the fuck up
a standalone Darth Vader film
why that's gonna be awesome
why let me light my alter to Star Wars and pray to the Star Wars gods for giving us more films
Darth Vader
anakin
doesn't he know those movies made like a billion dollars each
that means they're good
anyway you know critics of JJ Abrams have called him and Star Wars Episode seven racist for not casting any Asians in the film
wow
that's just terrible
"do you plan on having any Asian characters join the cast of any of these star wars films"
so rumor is Star Wars Episode eight has cast Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen
Wow
that's just great
it shows just how much Disney cares about diversity in their casting choices
as well as increasing box office sales in the Chinese market
"no asians"
but since audiences can't wait a whole year for the official Star Wars
and Studios can't wait a year without making tons of money
they're planning for Star Wars spin-off films at least once a year for the next 17 years
oh my god so much Star Wars I want to gouge out my fucking eyes
the first film is going to be about the adventures of a young Han Solo
Robert Rodriguez is rumored to direct
oh I love his kids films
they are just so good
they're also planning in 2018 for a film about the origins of Boba Fett
yeah it's called Attack of the Clones
what
would you shut the fuck up
nobody liked Attack of the Clones
this is fucking crap
people like Boba Fett cuz he's awesome
they want to see him flying around in his jetpack and shooting people and doing awesome things
that's so cool because he's so awesome and mysterious
look guys
Boba Fett is cool because he's mysterious
if they make a movie about him then it kind of ruins all of that
I'm sorry
what
there's a Yoda standalone film in 2021
Lawrence Kasdan is rumored to write
an Admiral Ackbar origin story
Lawrence Kasdan rumor to write
a Jabba the Hutt spin-off film
Lawrence Kasdan and Lawrence Kasdan rumored to write
and a movie all about the ugnauts from the director of minions
kids are gonna love that
I mean what kids don't love mute midget pigs
but Jay are they making a r2d2 origin stands alone spin-off film
I would love to know where r2d2 came from
what's his backstory
where was he built I'm sure he was built by a young Yoda when he was living in the spice mines of Kessel training to be a spice miner
that's a great idea
Yoda built r2d2
of course
why not
and then and then Yoda introduced him to Han Solo's fetus
now that's a little weird
you know what
screw continuity
people want more obi-wan
let's give him it
Obi Wan's adventures after episode three a standalone film
I always thought obi-wan lived like a boring lonely life on Tatooine is like a hermit
you know I always thought it was like his self-imposed sentence for his failure to train Anakin bringing about the downfall of Jedi
I'm sorry
what
are you talking
is he talking
but Mike what about the stars of star wars
you know Mark Hamill Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford
will they be back for more Star Wars adventures
well rumor is they've hired Colin Trevorrow the director of Jurassic world to direct Star Wars Episode nine
so I bet they'll be back
why are you so sure
well why else would they hire someone who's so good at directing dinosaurs
