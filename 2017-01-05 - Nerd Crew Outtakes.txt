I am Rich Evans and I am a giant piece of horseshit.
hello everyone my name is Mike Stoklasa I'm the founder of redlettermedia which is an online movie review site dedicated to all things
fuck
and I am rich Evans
uh I am a giant piece of horseshit
dammit mike
try it one more time
I'm sorry
well the PR person from Disney emailed us and said he's been following our site for a little while and noticed that we
what did you do
I nodded
I nodded
okay
i'll try not to look at rich again
that's why I'm not looking at it at all
well the PR person from Disney emailed uh us and said he's been following our websites for a while now
damn it
okay
I'm gonna look at the camera
okay
go
i gotta, i gotta steady this thing
yeah
okay
well the PR person from Disney emailed us and said that they've been following our website for a while now and notice that we had a pretty big
sorry
I'm so sorry
okay
maybe don't do it this time
okay
because we have footage of you doing
okay
there you go
there you go
okay
I just wanted to get a little footage of that
oh yeah
you can cut that in anywhere
well I don't want to speak for rich
I think he was talking about the tone of the film
rich were you talking about the tone
no it was very hard to see
well I think you're overlooking the fact that the grittiness of this movie that validates me as an adult who likes a children's fantasy series
that's good
that's good
that's a good point
well I personally love this film but I'd like to talk about
sorry
uh so the opening of a new hope was just a little bit more visceral and uh stupid
and we also need you know grand moff tarkin to look exactly like grand moff tarkin did
It would have been a huge mistake just to cast a different actor to play that role
uh what  they really needed to do is what they did which was to dig out the Polar Express creepy CGI
too sarcastic
too much
too far
we got to ride the line more
yeah
well me personally I love this film
sorry
you get sent a box with the you know dollar store toys
right right
it makes you think
and it makes me think why couldn't they just beam the plans up to the spaceship
I personally love this film but I would like to talk about how much that scene they added in added to uh Darth Vader's character
now now we all love the original trilogy but one of the problems I have with a new hope is really the introduction of the character of Darth Vader
in the opening that movie when the the Imperials storm the the corvette cruiser and then they murder all the rebels and that huge gun battle happens
and then as as the smoke is clearing uh uh darth vader ominously comes out of the shadows after his minions have have done his dirty work for him
because he's a powerful character and he has people who does that form and he's clearly in charge
but but you know what in a rogue one when he brings out his lightsaber and then he hacks up a bunch of people and kills them with the force
that's really how you're supposed to handle that character
yeah it's true
you're exactly right rich
and I always thought that that was a big plot hole
in a new hope was you know the stormtroopers they're they're expendable right
sure
but you know you don't like Darth Vader really could have come through and just killed everyone on that ship without
he's got the force
yeah
he's got the force
yeah, he's a sith lord
yeah yeah
you want to see your villain take people out in the most simplistic manner possible uh with no sort of uh layers to the character
that's what you want in a villain
but but instead of killing everyone himself with his with his awesome lightsaber he lets like 10 or 20 stormtroopers die which I think was a bad use of resources
it's just it's just a letdown for an action scene
it really makes me wish that Disney uh had the Star Wars property back when a new hope was made
and they could have made the proper adjustments so the opening of a new hope was just a little bit more visceral uh and stupid
uh you know some people might complain that the characters are a little shallow not fleshed out all that much
but I think that's very important when you're making a war film which is what this is
yeah
well I mean I mean it's war film and usually in a war film most of your characters will die
uh so really why you know why get to know them
it just you know a it's like um uh
it was really good
I think missing the fact that the seriousness though of everyone dying that really they're really sells home how important it is that the rebels have to blow up the Death Star 
it's not meant to be enjoyed per se as a conventional film
sure
um
it's it's merely it's it's uh it's merely an an event
an event a sequential event film on the screen that that shows how rebels got the thing that beamed the plans up to a ship
right
that burned them onto a cd-rom that a bunch of guys gave to some other guys in a corridor before being hacked to death by Darth Vader
well me personally I love this film because it makes me feel that pain
and I'm going to go see this movie multiple times
I've seen it five times already
even though every time I see it my six-year-old daughter cries when the young plucky female protagonist that she loves melts in a giant fireball at the end of the film
well that's life
that's life
yeah
you're teaching them valuable lessons at an early age
and that's what that's what the best art does
you're right
