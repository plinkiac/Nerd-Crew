RICH:
Uh, I am Rich Evans.
Uh, and I am a giant piece of horseshit.

MIKE:
Hello, everyone.
My name is Mike Stoklasa.
I am the founder of RedLetterMedia, which is an online movie review site dedicated to all things...fuck!

RICH:
And, uh, I am Rich Evans.
Uh, I am a giant piece of horseshit.

JAY:
Dammit, Mike!

MIKE:
Try it one more time.
I'm sorry.

JAY:
Well, the PR person from Disney emailed us and said he's been following our site for a little while, and noticed that we...what did you do?

RICH:
I nodded.
I nodded.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
I'll try not to look at Rich again.

JAY:
That's why I'm not looking at it at all.
Well, the PR person from Disney, uh, emailed us and said he's been following our website for a while now...dammit!

MIKE:
Okay.
I'm gonna look at the camera.
Okay.
Go.

RICH:
I gotta, I gotta steady this thing.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Well, the PR person from Disney emailed us and said they've been following our website for a while now, uh, and noticed that we had a pretty big...

MIKE:
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Okay.
Maybe don't do it this time.

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
Because we have footage of you doing.

RICH:
Okay.

JAY:
There you go.
There you go.

MIKE:
Okay.
I just wanted to get a little footage of that.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
You can cut that in anywhere.
Well, I don't want to speak for Rich.
I think he was talking about the tone of the film.
Rich, were you talking about the tone?

RICH:
No, it was very hard to see.
Well, I think you're overlooking the fact that the grittiness of this movie that validates me as an adult who, who likes a children's fantasy series.

MIKE:
That's good.
That's good.
That's a good point.

RICH:
Well, I personally love this film, but I'd like to talk about...

MIKE:
Sorry.

JAY:
Uh, so the opening of A New Hope was just a little bit more visceral and, uh, stupid.

RICH:
And we also need you know Grand Moff Tarkin to look exactly like Grand Moff Tarkin did.
It would have been a huge mistake just to cast a different actor to play that role.
Uh, what, what they really needed to do is what they did, which was to dig out the Polar Express creepy CGI.

MIKE:
Too sarcastic.
Too much.
Too far.
We got to ride the line more.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Well, me personally, I love this film.

MIKE:
Sorry.
You get sent a box with the you know dollar store toys.
Right, right.
It makes you think.
And it makes me think, why couldn't they just beam the plans up to the spaceship?

RICH:
I personally love this film, but I would like to talk about how much that scene they added in added to, uh, Darth Vader's character.
Uh, uh, now, now, we all love the original trilogy, but one of, one of the problems I have with A New Hope is really the introduction of the character of, of Darth Vader.
In the opening of that movie, when the, the Imperials storm the, the Corvette Cruiser, and then they murder all of the Rebels, and that, that huge gun battle happens.
And then as as the smoke is clearing, uh, uh, Darth Vader ominously comes out of the shadows after his minions have, have done his dirty work for him.
Because he's a powerful character, and he has people who does that for him, and he's clearly in charge.
But, but, you know what, in a Rogue One, when he brings out his lightsaber, and then he hacks up a bunch of people and kills them with the Force, that's really how you're supposed to handle that character.

MIKE:
Yeah, it's true.
Um, you're exactly right, Rich.
And I always thought that that was a big, uh, plot hole.
In A New Hope was, you know, the stormtroopers, they're, they're expendable right?

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
But, you know, you don't, like, Darth Vader really could have come through and just killed everyone on that ship without...

RICH:
He's got the Force.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
He's got the Force.

MIKE:
Yeah, he's a Sith Lord.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.
You, you want to see your villain, uh, uh, take people out in the most simplistic manner possible, uh, with no sort of, uh, layers to the character.
That's what you want in a villain.

MIKE:
But, but instead of, uh, uh, killing everyone himself with his with his awesome lightsaber, he lets like 10 or 20 stormtroopers die, which I think was a bad use of resources.

RICH:
It's just, it's just a letdown for an action scene.

JAY:
It really makes me wish that Disney, uh, had the Star Wars property back when A New Hope was made.
Uh, and they could have made the proper adjustments so the opening of A New Hope was just a little bit more visceral, uh, and stupid.
Uh, you know, some people might complain that the characters are, uh, a little shallow, not fleshed out all that much.
But I think that's very important when, uh, you're making a war film, which is what this is.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Well, I mean, I mean it's war film, and usually in a war film most of your characters will die.
Uh, so really why, you know, why get to know them?
It, it just, you know, uh, it's like, um, uh...it was really good.

RICH:
I think missing the fact that the seriousness of everyone dying that really, that really sells home how, how important it is that the Rebels have to blow up the Death Star.

MIKE:
It's not meant to be enjoyed, per se, as a conventional film.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Um.
It's, it's merely, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, merely an, an event, an event, a sequential event film on the screen that, that shows how Rebels got the thing that beamed the plans up to a ship.

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
That burned them onto a CD-ROM that a bunch of guys gave to some other guys in a corridor before being hacked to death by Darth Vader.

RICH:
Well, me personally, I love this film because it makes me feel that pain.
And I'm going to go see this movie multiple times.
I've seen it five times already, even though every time I see it, my six-year-old daughter cries when the young plucky female protagonist that she loves melts in a giant fireball at the end of the film.

MIKE:
Well, that's life.
That's life.

JAY:
Yeah.
You're teaching them valuable lessons at an early age.
And that's what, that's what the best art does.

MIKE:
You're right.
