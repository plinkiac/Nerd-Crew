Hello, and welcome to The Nerd Crew.
I'm Mike and I'm what you might call a rock star in terms of people who make videos commenting on things you may have missed in movie trailers...on YouTube.
that's right, and I'm Jay
I'm sorry, I feel terrible.
I have the worst cold right now
and I haven't had anything to eat, so do you mind if I have just a little something.
is that okay.
sure
okay yeah I'm just gonna make a little something on my nice, uh, death star popcorn machine
so I know you guys weren't really prepared to shoot an episode of the nerd crew today but there is just so much breaking Star Wars news, that we had to film
I think he got more outside of the death star popcorn maker than he did inside the Death Star popcorn maker
I feel like I'm gonna pass out
can we just do this later
no Jay
we can't just do this later
look you signed a contract with Disney I mean this program to make pathetic fucking shell videos okay
rain or shine
now just because you don't feel good doesn't stop amazing star wars news from happening
and the duty that we have to talk about it on the internet
look why don't you take one of these kylo ren's Star Wars vitamins
maybe it'll make you feel better
fucking vitamins
don't they make Star Wars sudafed
they do but they were all out
and you know this machine it's so quiet, too
what
what
the machine, the Star Wars Death Star popcorn machine, it's so quiet, it's like a whisper
what's he saying
something about a popcorn machine
could you say that again buddy
what
did you say you say you're my buddy
I know we've known each other a long time
no, no, the thing you said before that there's something about the popcorn machine, the death star popcorn machine
oh, yeah, the death star popcorn machine
one of the best features of this Star Wars Death Star popcorn machine is that it's whisper quiet
at home when I'm running a vacuum cleaner, you can hardly hear it
I agree I didn't vote for Trump either
right, right
are we still making the fucking popcorn
and the machine's, the machine fine
look, as you can see the quality craftsmanship on this
oh, my god
it looks just like the Death Star
oh my god
you're spilling hot butter all over the table
there's an awful lot of smoke
where, where, where are the Star Wars, uh, wipes
I don't think the butter is supposed to go on top of the popcorn maker
I, I think there's a problem
Is it supposed to do that
Why is my popcorn on fire
I think the machine's on fire
oh my god
um, do we have, that's, like, really on fire
I think that's taken care of the problem but there seems to be more smoke
Is it supposed to do that
Oh, my god
Quick, get the Anakin Skywalker fire extinguisher
I'm too weak to stand up
Who would've thought that the Death Star popcorn machine would have one fatal flaw built into it
So, uh, uh, anyway, uh, uh, the popcorn itself, it's, it's tasty
So, recently, Entertainment Weekly posted a series of images from Star Wars Episode VII
Ooh, I haven't seen those yet
yeah
very cool
and since rich hasn't seen them yet, Jay, why don't you get out your iPad if you remember those, and rich, you could take a look at the images as we discuss them in detail
there you go, there's the iPad
did you get this at a goodwill
here, rich
here's the iPad
this is our first image
so, um, we're gonna put these up on the screen, but rich is also gonna gonna be looking at them
and this is an exclusive first look for rich
rich has not seen these images
I can't wait
I can't wait.
they've been out for weeks, but somehow he has not seen them
now, what we're gonna talk about first is how amazing this first image is
the variation in her costume is incredible
uh, we see, she has less sleeves than she did in, in, in the first movie
well, it definitely looks like she's still wearing rags
they're just slightly different colored rags
a slight different variation of a homeless person costume
and now we know that you know this is the same location that we saw at the end of the force awakens
we'll see that same location again
I was wondering if the film would have any continuity with the previous one
I believe the rocks in the background is the location where she meets Luke Skywalker
I'm sorry is this an exclusive because I was unaware that the rock was in this film
that's quality
now in this next image we see Rey talking to Luke Skywalker
and if you'll notice Luke Skywalker is standing inside the cave, while Rey is on the outside
neither of them look very happy, and I'm just gonna go out on a limb and I'm gonna say they're having a disagreement of some kind
maybe he wants to stay
maybe she wants to go
but I think the most important thing to take from this image is her hairstyle is different
very cool
it is very cool
it's done in three buns
that's such an amazing twist on the previous film
now because Mark Hamill is standing in this doorway and there's a separation between them maybe Rey is just waiting for Mark Hamill to get out of the way so that she can walk inside in the scene
maybe she has to use the bathroom
now has it been confirmed that this is indeed an image from the last Jedi and maybe not some other film
now, now the tip of her staff looks like it might be some sort of a lightsaber
oh
so maybe maybe this is a lightsaber staff
we haven't seen that before
we haven't seen that before
we have never seen a lightsaber staff before in star wars
we have not seen that before
exclusive information that we now maybe possibly have what could be a lightsaber staff
now rich would this have a lightsaber, uh, I want to say lightsaber ejaculate but really it's a it's a lightsaber, uh, I want to say "erection"
it's a lightsaber penis
what, what is, a sword, a blade, blade is the word I'm looking for
it's a saber
it's a lightsaber
is is the blade going to come out on both ends of the staff or would that be too close to Darth Maul's staff
I think it's going to be like a lightsaber spear
it's just gonna be one tiny lightsaber out of the tip
and this is a lightsaber meant for throwing
oh my lord
we have never seen that in a Star Wars film before
this is an exclusive
this could be brand-new material here everybody
brand new
ooh
my mind
just like our popcorn machine
now rich why don't we go on to our next image which is not of Rey and Luke Skywalker
Uh, it is a familiar character Finn with a new character who I'm not familiar with
rich can you describe the image even though we're gonna put it up on the screen
rich is seeing this image for the first time
he's seing all these images it's the first time
this image tells me there are minorities in this film
and, and that's great because you know the Star Wars it's more diverse than it's ever been
that's true
this is true
this is, we have never had a minority in a star wars film before, ever
this is true
it's very true
very true
it is incredible
very diverse
so while white people still have all of the main roles in the Star Wars universe, I am still proud of Disney for taking this bold step and giving minorities all of the less important side roles
well, kudos to Disney for taking this brave but still safe marketing decision
Disney is very inclusive, but not too inclusive
now if only the Avengers could be a little more inclusive
if I wanted to see a cracker factory I'd visit Nabisco
oh, snap
What is that
Oh, sorry, I'm hungry
okay, guys, let's move on to our next image
ready, rich
here we go
I'm gonna, I am gonna swipe now
the fuck is that
this isn't real, right
this is a, this is a prank
are they taking a shared universe to the next level
are we, are we incorporating Caddyshack into the Star Wars universe
yeah it's very clear that's someone photoshopped a Furby into that image or something because Disney knows not to go that overboard with the cutesy marketable stuff 
it's a very funny prank
I never thought Entertainment Weekly had a really really great sense of humor until now to publish fake images
maybe Ashton Kutcher was the guest editor because he hosted that punk show 37 years ago
I remember that show called Punk'd
do you remember Punk'd
when I saw the Phantom Menace I thought I was being Punk'd
I just confirmed it
it's real guys
and it's amazing
it's very cool
it's very cool
very cool
very cool
that little creature is just, it's just gonna be gold
now rich we're gonna move on to our next exclusive image
this is an image of characters that are apparently Luke's caretakers on the island that he lives on
are you ready
I'm ready
I'm gonna swipe now
Um, I, I think you made some kind of mistake
this is quite clearly station from Bill and Ted's bogus journey
I have confirmed this
it's real guys
oh
well, it's very cool
very cool
very cool
I can't wait to see these characters on screen in Star Wars
they look incredible
now that it's been confirmed that that is not station from Bill and Ted's bogus journey I think it's an incredibly creative and original idea and vision
I think these creepy creepy monsters that will give children nightmares are just gonna sell like hotcakes
they're adorable
they're almost as adorable as the Furby
they look like a turd with a face
you know what this looks likeit kinda looks like if you know ET had sex with the sadness turtle from the neverending story
Oh
These, this
Right, right
Sorry, Jay was coughing again
Jay, if you need to use the Darth Vader humidifier, I've plugged it in for you
you just turn the knob on the back
there you go
hopefully this won't blow up
I've put some vicks vapor rub inside it
oh it smells like James Earl Jones
this smells like some sort of chemical
what, what did you put in here
uh, battery acid
it smells like something that I should not be ingesting
I read on Oprah's website that battery acid was good for a cold
if you start bleeding from your nose, we know it's working
is it supposed to make you feel more sick
guys, I've got some new information coming in on the official nerd crew monitor
it looks like Disney has just announced plans for an obi-wan Kenobi standalone film
oh my god
that is so cool
very cool
now this is great news because it was completely unexpected
this is such a unique turn that I would have not considered Disney would take with Star Wars
who would have known
you know the great thing about this is that it's a character that we know
rich where is obi-wan
where would he be for a standalone film
well well well after Revenge of the Sith, uh, Obi-Wan clearly goes to Tatooine
mm-hmm
and we know he spends the next 17 years just wandering around Tatooine
so I I think we can expect to see a lot of sand and, uh, uh, meditation
well, yeah, that's not gonna make for a very exciting film so I have a feeling Obi-Wan is gonna leave Tatooine and maybe go on some kind of crazy fucked up adventure
a lot can happen in 17 years that no one will ever mention again
might, might I be so bold as to suggest the return of Darth Maul
Ooh
Ooh
we never officially saw him die
we only saw him get cut in half
that's correct rich
you can get cut in half and still survive
just like my grandpa in the Second World War
we called him old halvsy
so rich if Darth Maul did survive the plunge down into that pit on Naboo does he have robot legs
oh I was gonna say skateboard but robot legs that's much cooler
that would just be amazing
you know I bet he could run really fast like as fast as someone with robot legs
I can just imagine the action figure line
Darth Maul is Darth Maul
the iconic Darth Maul that we know and love except for he has robot legs
and that's the difference
what's really amazing is that it's Darth Maul but with robot legs
what if both halves of Darth Maul get robotic replacements
oh my gosh like he fell into some kind of factory
like he fell on some kind of like robot factory that was at the bottom of Naboo
and then like like the top half of cars Maul gets merged with like the bottom half of an R2 unit
and we get to see you know more details and how R2 units can get around in rough terrain
Oh, very cool
And fly around with R2 rocket boosters
Yeah, yeah
And in the bottom half of Darth Maul we'll get like mixed with some kind of spider robot
and he'll have even more legs
and then at the end of the movie obi-wan Kenobi has to team up with the top half of Darth Maul to fight off the eight-legged bottom half of Darth Maul
wow that sounds so awesome
that is very cool rich
very cool yeah
I believe Carrie Fisher misspoke when she said Star Wars is about family
"It's about family, and that's what's so powerful about it."
Star Wars is about a half Darth Maul with a robot bottom.
star wars is really about a top half Darth Maul robot and a bottom half Darth Maul robot fighting each other with 20 lightsabers while obi-wan is stuck in the middle 
hang on guys
something's coming in on the official nerd crew computer monitor
oh my god
Disney has now just announced plans for a job of the Hutt standalone film
a movie about a gangster slug that doesn't speak English sounds so appealing
it sounds very cool
remember who's writing the checks here
very cool
well, they want, you know, they wanna, they wanna expand their audience they want more women to come in and see a movie
and they think women want to see a movie about a fat slug who is corpulent and can't move
they've already made Kevin Smith films
oh my god
my Star Wars news feed is going haywire
what's on the BBS now
guys, Disney is announcing plans for Star Wars standalone films at a rapid pace
I can't even keep up
there's another one coming in now
it's a standalone film for 4-LOM
who the fuck is 4-LOM
it's one of the bounty hunters from Empire Strikes Back
oh I've never seen it
oh my god in 2028 we're gonna be treated to a general Rieekan standalone film
and if you don't remember who that is it's the general from Empire Strikes Back who orders the evacuation of Hoth
he's got a whole backstory about his service in the Rebellion
and let me tell you it's gonna be amazing
"We better start the evacuation."
he's gonna have deal with claims of being a coward because he fled from Hoth rather than standing his ground
we'll just have to ask Lawrence Kasdan because he's rumored to write
you know I was just thinking
is calling them standalone films is that offensive to paraplegics
I think Disney should really take this into consideration
Oh Jay, that's that's a really good point
I hadn't thought about that before
you know maybe maybe we should organize some kind of protest or March about this because I can I can really sympathize with the paraplegics you know
I I know how they feel because sometimes I'm just too lazy to stand or walk myself
they've just announced another standalone film
well this one's not happening till 2054, so we have a little bit of a wait
I've already pre-ordered my tickets
oh, yes
very cool
what is it
what is this movie, Mike
I need to know
I need to know 
I'm gonna say it
can you tell us the title of the film or who the main character is
I don't know the title but I can tell you who it's about
it's a standalone film about Lobot
ah, yes
wait, who's Lobot
Lobot's the guy from Empire Strikes Back
Lando's friend
the bald guy with the robot head
the robotic implant in the back of his head
the guy who's just standing in the background
rich, everybody knows Lobot
oh that's my favorite character
well I'm sure we're all very familiar with Lobot but for the sake of the audience
yes, yes
you know, we want to make sure that everybody is up to date on lobot
okay guys I'm going on to Wookiepedia now and now and I'm looking up Lobot
okay
Lobot also known by the nickname "lo" or chrome-dome was a male human from the planet bespin who with the assistance of his aj6 cyborg construct was paid to run battlefield calculations for the Galactic Empire
however he eventually began working with the smuggler Lando Calrissian aboard the Millennium Falcon running numerous criminal jobs
during one job the theft of the Emperor's personal yacht, the Galactic terror, Lobot...
wait, wait, the Emperor's personal yacht was called the Galactic Terror
Lobot was gravely wounded by an imperial guard when he was hit in the back of the head by a wudu claw, which scraped his brainstem
Lobot served as Calrissian's aide, personal confidant, and chef
after being denied entrance to the mas Eisley cantina due to his cyborg nature
"hey we don't serve their kind here"
"what"
Lobot then organized the peaceful protests or "sit-in" with other cyborgs in the cantina
he eventually won the right to drink at the dive bar and was awarded cyborg ofthe Year by Jabba the Hutt at a ceremony on Bespin
this Lobot backstory sounds incredible
very cool
well, guys, this is exciting there is just so much Star Wars news coming out every day
what a great time to be alive
