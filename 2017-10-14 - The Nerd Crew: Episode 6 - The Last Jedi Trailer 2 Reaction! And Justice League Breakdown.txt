MIKE:
Hello, I'm Mike, and welcome to The Nerd Crew. We were just recently ranked number 8967th for your online source for movie trailer reaction videos.

JAY:
I'm Jay, and even though I was on Screen Junkies once, I guarantee I am not a dirtbag.

RICH:
And I'm Rich Evans and I am borderline elderly. And balding. But it's not beneath me to film myself reacting to movie trailers online.

MIKE:
Oh, Rich. Give yourself a little more credit. Your YouTube fast food review channel is quite popular and very informative.

RICH:
I have here the Hardee's Two-Third Monster. It's got, uh, uh, mayo, bacon, and cheese. All right, let's, let's try this. It's good. It's got a good taste. The taste is good. I would get it again. So, thank you for watching. Uh, be sure to like and subscribe.

MIKE:
Well, gentlemen today's the day we've been waiting for since the last Star Wars trailer came out. It's the day that the next Star Wars trailer came out.

JAY:
That's, right Mike. With the first Last Jedi trailer, we got very little information. And I'm happy to report that with this new Last Jedi trailer, we got very little information.

MIKE:
So little information. And you know what? I don't want information. I just want to see the movie.

JAY:
I'm gonna see the film, regardless.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
I'm going to see the film. I'm going to see Star Wars. Because it's Star Wars. It says Star Wars on it. I'm going to see it.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Well, that's the most important thing: Star Wars. Now, a lot of you are gonna say, "Why bother analyzing a trailer so much? You know, the movie's just gonna be about lightsaber fights, a giant space battle, and something about destiny."

JAY:
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I thought there was gonna be a "but" at the end of that.

RICH:
No. That was, that was it.

JAY:
Very cool.

MIKE:
Very cool.

RICH:
Very cool.

MIKE:
Very cool.

JAY:
Star Wars.

MIKE:
It's back again, everybody. It's back again until it's gone, and then it's back again.

RICH:
It's back again, and it's completely different and revolutionary, yet at the same time, it's all of the things you expect exactly as you expect them.

MIKE:
Well, Rich it's funny you brought up the trailer. Because that's why we're here today, everybody. We're here to talk about the Star Wars trailer for The last Jedi. Uh, and it's very exciting news. The trailer came out Monday during football. I don't know why came out during football. Um, I don't imagine a lot of Star Wars fans watch football. But maybe they do now because Star Wars is, is transformative. I see so many brainless jocks wearing Star Wars t-shirts now because it's popular again. And, and to me, that's very cool. That's very cool. It means morons can enjoy entertainment that's now made for morons. And, and, really, that, that, it's very welcoming. It's very welcoming. It's very diverse. But we, we took a look at the trailer. We usually don't, don't do trailer reaction videos, um...

JAY:
Except for when we do.

MIKE:
Except for when we do. And this time I thought it was warranted because literally there's nothing going on in this trailer, and I really wanted to catch our genuine reactions to that.

JAY:
Well, speaking of trailer reactions, uh, as everyone knows, we did get burned with our last attempt.

JAY:
Whoa.

MIKE:
Whoa.

RICH:
Whoa.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Holy shit.

CLIP:
"Stop calling me Ben!"

RICH:
He just dropp-...

MIKE:
Don't call him Ben. He doesn't like that!

JAY:
Yes!

MIKE:
Yes!

RICH:
Whoo!

JAY:
Yes!

RICH:
Well, Mike I'm 80% sure that this time, it's real.

MIKE:
So, each of us one at a time, went into a production office at our corporate headquarters and watched the new Star Wars trailer. We, of course, filmed our reactions. Let's take a look at it now.

JAY:
Looks like Kylo Ren, but where is he, The First Order?

RICH:

JAY:

RICH:

MIKE:

JAY:
Star Wars: The Last Jedi, we know the title now!

RICH:
Oh, my god, it's Star Wars, Star Wars is back, oh, my g-!

MIKE:
Oh, oh, fucking god, oh, oh, I can't wait, oh, fuck!

RICH:
Wow, we all had such different reactions.

MIKE:
It's amazing, Rich, how different our reactions were and how we weren't pre-programmed by a large corporation to respond to visual imagery.

RICH:
Yeah, we are all individuals.

MIKE:
Well, guys, let's just get right into it because this movie looks like it has so many new and original ideas. Like AT-AT walker's attacking on a snow planet, for instance.

JAY:
As well as a young Jedi being trained by an old master. Even a solo training mission in a misty cave where he or she uncovers a terrible truth.

RICH:
And what appears to be a final confrontation with the main villain, which apparently ends in a cliffhanger.

JAY:
It's amazing. I haven't seen such original ideas since Star Trek: Into Darkness.

RICH:
You know, you know what, Jay, you're not going far back enough. I haven't seen anything like this since Empire Strikes Back.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay. Now we can look forward to December when this next Star Wars film comes out. We can watch it, love it, and then wait for the next trailer to come out, which will be for the Han Solo standalone film. Then we could watch that trailer and endlessly speculate about what will be in that movie, until that movie comes out. Then we can watch it and love it, and then when that's over...

RICH:
But don't forget, Mike, while you're waiting for that, there's Infinity War.

MIKE:
...and all we'll have to do is wait for the Episode XI trailer to come out. And then we can endlessly speculate about what will happen in the final film of that trilogy. And then when that's over, we can wait for the Jabba the Hut standalone film trailer to come out, and endlessly speculate about that movie.

RICH:
But also, don't forget Mike, while you're waiting for that to come out: Wonder Woman 2! Darkseid in the house!

MIKE:
...Star Wars: Episode X, the start of a new trilogy. And that trailer will come out, and endlessly speculate about what will happen in this new trilogy. Are we gonna get the same characters? Will it be set in the past, or the future? Will Rey be back? Will Finn be back? Will Han Solo be back? Maybe there'll be a prequel.

RICH:
While you're waiting for that to come out, don't forget about Infinity War 2! Thanos in the house!

MIKE:
But, guaranteed we're gonna get episodes X, XI, and XII. But in between those, after Episode X comes out, we can watch it, we think, "Eh, it's pretty good, I still love Star Wars!"

RICH:
But Mike, don't forget while you're waiting for that to come out, Marvel's Infinity War 3. Thanos in the house!

MIKE:
We can wait for the standalone trailer for the Obi-Wan Kenobi standalone film.

RICH:
But Mike, don't forget while you're waiting for that to come out: Justice League 2! Darkseid in the house!

MIKE:And then we can endlessly speculate, what does Obi-Wan do on Tatooine in between Star Wars: Episodes III and IV? I'm sure he has a lot of amazing adventures. And then we can wait for that film to come out.

JAY:
Very cool.

MIKE:
And when that film comes out, we'll say, "That was great, I still love Star Wars!"

RICH:
But Mike, don't forget while you're waiting for that to come out: Thor 4! Thanos in the house!

MIKE:
And then after that, we can wait for the Star Wars: Episode XI trailer to come out.

RICH:
But Mike, while you're waiting for that to come out, don't forget about Batman v Superman v Wonder Woman v Aquaman 3. Darkseid in the house!

MIKE:
And then when that trailer comes out, we'll watch it and endlessly speculate about what will happen in Star Wars: Episode XI, when a new, new Star Wars trilogy, which will probably be a dark film, much like Empire Strikes Back and The Last Jedi.

RICH:
But don't forget, Mike, while you're waiting for that to come out, Infinity War 3: Part 2. Doctor Strange crossover with Ant-Man. Thanos in the house!

MIKE:
Because the second film in a three-film series is always darker. And then when that film comes out, we can watch that and then endlessly speculate about what will happen in Star Wars: Episode XII. Are they gonna go back to Yoda's origin, when Yoda was a Padawan? 

JAY:
Now, guys, uh, I'm sorry to interrupt but, uh, to get back to the Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer, uh, you know, I'd like to speculate a little bit about the themes that the film is going for. Uh, and I think it's going to be an extension of what Star Wars has always been about, and that is family.

MIKE:
Just shut up. The next thing we want to talk about on today's Nerd Crew is another big trailer that dropped recently. And, Rich, your outfit says it all. I'm talking about the Justice League.

JAY:
Oh, wow. I'm very excited about that film, too.

MIKE:
And while we didn't film ourselves reacting to this trailer, we are going to break it down shot-by-shot so we can analyze just what we think is gonna happen in this new Justice League film.

JAY:
That's right, Mike. Now, me personally, I do love the Marvel films. I think they're fun, adventurous, and enthralling. But, you know, they are more aimed at children. When I want a darker, more intelligent comic book film, I turn to DC.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay. DC is what I like to call "the thinking man's comic book film". Nothing against Marvel, of course.

JAY:
Oh, no. We love Marvel.

RICH:
Oh, no, Marvel is great. Marvel is great.

MIKE:
But this new Justice League film appears to be dealing with much heavier thematic issues than the Marvel films deal with. Issues like: the world is changing, teamwork, and stopping evil space bugs.

RICH:
Hmm, wow, that's that's really smart, Mike. You know, I've, I've never looked at it through that lens before. You know, this winter, I was planning on, you know, taking up some classic literature. I was gonna read some Faulkner, some, some Joyce, some Dostoevsky. But if I could just watch a movie about a merman hurling a trident at some space insects, I can really save my time.

MIKE:
There's, there's a lot to be said about the imagery of a cyborg hurling a merman into the sky so that that Merman can throw his trident at a space insect. I mean, it speaks volumes about our culture, about the state of our nation, and the world.

RICH:
Yeah, you know, you're, you're really right, Mike. But, you know, DC, they are, they're a bit more, uh, sophisticated than the Marvel films. I love the Marvel films.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
We all love Marvel.

MIKE:
They are fun, fun, fun films.

JAY:
They're colorful, they're adventurous.

RICH:
They are fun, fun, sometimes you just wanna turn your brain off.

MIKE:
They're popcorn films, they're popcorn films.

JAY:
And that's fine.

MIKE:
And that's fine, that's fine, that's totally fine.

JAY:
Shut your brain off and enjoy it.

RICH:
Shut your brain off and enjoy it.

MIKE:
We love popcorn.

RICH:
But ultimately, you know, they're more simplistic movies. And in the Marvel movies, you know, the heroes, they gotta, they gotta learn to work together as a team. And they gotta, they have to team up to fight, you know, the, the giant purple space emperor who wants to take over the planet with aliens. You know, it's, you know, then you look at the DC films, and we have, we have something different going on here.

JAY:
Much darker.

MIKE:
Much, much darker.

RICH:
You know, we have a movie where -- yeah, much darker -- where, like, Batman and Wonder Woman and, and, and The Flash, and Aquaman, you know, they have to, they have to come together. You know, they have to come together. They have to learn to work as a team. And then they need to team up to fight against Darkseid, the, the giant purple space emperor. And he's getting, you know, he's trying to use his space alien army to take over the earth.

MIKE:
That's very different, and, and very distinct.

JAY:
Yes, yes.

RICH:
They're completely different. Thanos is a purple space emperor who wants to find the Infinity Gauntlet so he can take over the universe.

MIKE:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
But Darkseid is a purple space emperor who wants to find the Anti-Life Equation so he can take over the universe.

MIKE:
Yes. That was a very, very sophisticated way of explaining the difference to some people who might not get it. You know, they might think we're ragging on Marvel, but...

JAY:
We love Marvel.

RICH:
We love Marvel.

MIKE:
We love, we love those films.

JAY:
They're great, they're adventurous.

RICH:
They're fun films, full of characters you love.

JAY:
Absolutely, absolutely.

MIKE:
But because the picture is literally visually darker in the DC films, that implies that their tone is darker.

JAY:
Well, that's interesting, Mike. I, I like that you brought up the aesthetic of the films, and that's what I'm really looking forward to with this Justice League movie, is that Zack Snyder's aesthetic is all over this trailer.

MIKE:
Jay, you are aware they replaced Zack Snyder with Joss Whedon and he reshot over half the film?

JAY:
Oh, isn't that the guy that did The Avengers?

MIKE:
Yeah, clearly the DC films are operating on a, on a higher intellectual level than the Marvel films, and...

RICH:
You can tell because of the blue filter.

MIKE:
I don't know if Thanos even has an army of insect monsters. Um, we're in theory zone here. We've analyzed the trailer, and we discovered several things. One, there's going to be a heavy present theme of teamwork, which is important. I mean, individually, they could fight space bugs, but Batman says in the film, "We're stronger together then we are apart."

JAY:
That line, that line really hit me. It hit me right here.

MIKE:
It gave me chills.

JAY:
Yes, yes.

MIKE:
It literally gave me chills.

RICH:
What DC did that was really smart, you know, really smart, they, they used a previous movie in their franchise to, to hint at the space bugs. You know, in Batman v Superman, Batman has visions of the space bugs that we as the audience, "Oh, we, we know what's coming next".

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
That's just that that extra special DC touch that only they could do.

MIKE:
That's planning, too. That's what that says. That's planning. It's thinking ahead in your film series. Like how Ben Affleck is going to come back as Batman again. That's planning. But really, gentlemen, what this film is about is teamwork. And you can't, you can't have a superhero film without teamwork.

JAY:
Uh, but in addition to teamwork, I do think that what the Justice League is ultimately going to be about is family.

MIKE:
Shut up. So after reviewing the footage of us reacting to The Last Jedi trailer, I did notice that one camera was left recording. And that was when Rich was watching The Last Jedi trailer. So, I don't know, Rich, did you happen to turn on the Justice League trailer after?

RICH:
Wh-, the camera was still on?

MIKE:
Yeah, after, after you watched the last Jedi trailer. It was rolling for about 30 minutes. Um, did you happen to watch the Justice League trailer?

JAY:
Well, maybe we can just play back the footage?

RICH:
Uh, no, uh, uh.

MIKE:
Yeah. Um...

JAY:
Jeremy, Jeremy, can you play the footage?

RICH:
Take that, you fucking porg! What did you say, porg? Are you in Star Wars? I fucking love Star Wars!
